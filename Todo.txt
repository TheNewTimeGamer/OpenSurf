Implement World Record.
    - Do this check on completion of run.
    - Save world record seperately so you don't have to loop through all the runs. (Maybe do check once in a while to be sure?)
    - Display Server wide message (also networking) announcing a new world record.

Save everything to disk.
    - All runs players have completed.
    - Maybe prepare for stuff like, time played and points.
    - Admin stuff?
    - Save in format so it can easily be used, including by external programs.

Load stuff from disk.
    - Load player data on login.
    - Load World Record data. (Should be saved seperately, I.E: Not bound to player profile.)
    - Limit memory usage, both on client and server.

Create Scoreboard.

Implement support for more maps. (Kitsun 1 next?)

Ask Kevin for playtesting.

Try hosting on a Dedicated Server.

Replays? (A bit hard to implement but should be cool)

Overal Code improvements. Specifically look at colon(:) and dot(.) functions.
Where possible everything should be converted to colon(:) usage.
